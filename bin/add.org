Use -z to check if the first argument is blank. If it is we don't have a package name to add.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    >&2 echo "Please pass a package name to append."
    exit 1
#+END_SRC

If the second argument is empty we'll use the default location of my arch setup package otherwise we'll use the second argument to set the path.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ -z "$2" ]; then
    SETUP_FILE=/home/james/Sync/Scripts/arch_setup.sh
else
    SETUP_FILE=$2
fi

#+END_SRC

If there are somehow more than 2 arguments passed in something has gone wrong and we need to bail.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ $# -gt 2 ]; then
    >&2 echo "Too many arguments. I don't know what to do."
    exit 1
fi
#+END_SRC

We use -n to suppress the newline so it appends to the existing line of packages in the file.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
echo -n "$1" >> $SETUP_FILE
#+END_SRC
